<h2 id="welcome">Welcome! üëã</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a>
challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic
projects.</p>
<p><strong>To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and
get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
<p>You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So
if you‚Äôve got something you‚Äôd like to practice, feel free to give it a
go.</p>
<p>Your users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device‚Äôs
screen size</li>
<li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
<li>Select and submit a number rating</li>
<li>See the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù card state after submitting a rating</li>
</ul>
<p>Want some support on the challenge? <a

and ask questions in the <strong>#help</strong> channel.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-find-everything">Where to find everything</h2>
<p>Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the
<code>/design</code> folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop
version of the design.</p>
<p>The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that
you‚Äôll need to use your best judgment for styles such as
<code>font-size</code>, <code>padding</code> and
<code>margin</code>.</p>
<p>If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch &amp; Figma
versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can <a
href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro">subscribe as a PRO
member</a>.</p>
<p>You will find all the required assets in the <code>/images</code>
folder. The assets are already optimized.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>style-guide.md</code> file containing the
information you‚Äôll need, such as color palette and fonts.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-project">Building your project</h2>
<p>Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below
is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these
steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initialize your project as a public repository on <a
href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Creating a repo will make it
easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you‚Äôre
not sure how to do this, <a href="https://try.github.io/">have a
read-through of this Try Git resource</a>.</li>
<li>Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.
This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you
can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a
number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations
below.</li>
<li>Look through the designs to start planning out how you‚Äôll tackle the
project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to
create reusable styles.</li>
<li>Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing
your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating
well-structured content.</li>
<li>Write out the base styles for your project, including general
content styles, such as <code>font-family</code> and
<code>font-size</code>.</li>
<li>Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move
on to the next section once you‚Äôre happy you‚Äôve completed the area
you‚Äôre working on.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deploying-your-project">Deploying your project</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for
free. Our recommend hosts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our
other trusted providers. <a
href="https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe">Read
more about our recommended and trusted hosts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-custom-readme.md">Create a custom
<code>README.md</code></h2>
<p>We strongly recommend overwriting this <code>README.md</code> with a
custom one. We‚Äôve provided a template inside the <a
href="./README-template.md"><code>README-template.md</code></a> file in
this starter code.</p>
<p>The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom
<code>README</code> will help you explain your project and reflect on
your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you
like.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve added your information to the template, delete this file
and rename the <code>README-template.md</code> file to
<code>README.md</code>. That will make it show up as your repository‚Äôs
README file.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-your-solution">Submitting your solution</h2>
<p>Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to
see. Follow our <a
href="https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248">‚ÄúComplete
guide to submitting solutions‚Äù</a> for tips on how to do this.</p>
<p>Remember, if you‚Äôre looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to
ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are
with your questions, the higher the chance you‚Äôll get valuable feedback
from the community.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-your-solution">Sharing your solution</h2>
<p>There are multiple places you can share your solution:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Share your solution page in the <strong>#finished-projects</strong>
channel of the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack">Slack
community</a>.</li>

you‚Äôve built and help share it around.</li>
<li>Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your
workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a
brilliant way to reinforce what you‚Äôve learned. Great platforms to write
