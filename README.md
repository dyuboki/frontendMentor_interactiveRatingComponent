## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project sort of acted as a refresher after not studying frontend development for a while.
As such it was a good way of getting back to it!

### Continued development

My dealing with forms feels a bit like I'm going massive detours while I could simplify the process quite a bit. Will look into that.
Also I would love to find a way to add transitions properly, but there are a lot of ways of doing that, should be looking into some of them.

Also gotta better organize CSS files, Good God..
